        "\n# Writing your environment with TorchRL\n**Author**: [Vincent Moens](https://github.com/vmoens)\n\nCreating an environment (a simulator or a interface to a physical control system)\nis an integrative part of reinforcement learning and control engineering.\n\nTorchRL provides a set of tools to do this in multiple contexts.\nThis tutorial demonstrates how to use PyTorch and :py:mod:`torchrl` code a pendulum\nsimulator from the ground up.\nIt is freely inspired by the Pendulum-v1 implementation from [OpenAI-Gym/Farama-Gymnasium\ncontrol library](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium)_.\n\n.. figure:: /_static/img/pendulum.gif\n   :alt: Pendulum\n\n   Simple Pendulum\n\nKey learnings:\n\n- How to design an environment in TorchRL:\n\n    - Specs (input, observation and reward);\n    - Methods: seeding, reset and step;\n- Transforming your environment inputs and outputs;\n- How to use :class:`tensordict.TensorDict` to carry arbitrary data structures\n  from sep to step.\n\nWe will touch three crucial components of TorchRL:\n\n* [environments](https://pytorch.org/rl/reference/envs.html)_\n* [transforms](https://pytorch.org/rl/reference/envs.html#transforms)_\n* [models (policy and value function)](https://pytorch.org/rl/reference/modules.html)_\n"

        "To give a sense of what can be achieved with TorchRL's environments, we will\nbe designing a stateless environment. While stateful environments keep track of\nthe latest physical state encountered and rely on this to simulate the state-to-state\ntransition, stateless environments expect the current state to be provided to\nthem at each step, along with the action undertaken.\n\nModelling stateless environments gives users full control over the input and\noutputs of the simulator: one can reset an experiment at any stage. It also\nassumes that we have some control over a task, which may not always be the case\n(solving a problem where we cannot control the current state is more challenging\nbut has a much wider set of applications).\n\nAnother advantage of stateless environments is that most of the time they allow\nfor batched execution of transition simulations. If the backend and the\nimplementation allow it, an algebraic operation can be executed seamlessly on\nscalars, vectors or tensors. This tutorial gives such examples.\n\nThis tutorial will be structured as follows:\n\n* We will first get acquainted with the environment properties:\n  its shape (``batch_size``), its methods (mainly `step`, `reset` and `set_seed`)\n  and finally its specs.\n* After having coded our simulator, we will demonstrate how it can be used\n  during training with transforms.\n* We will explore surprising new avenues that follow from the TorchRL's API,\n  including: the possibility of transforming inputs, the vectorized execution\n  of the simulation and the possibility of backpropagating through the\n  simulation.\n* Finally, will train a simple policy to solve the system we implemented.\n\n\n"

        "There are four things one must take care of when designing a new environment\nclass: ``_reset``, which codes for the resetting of the simulator at a (potentially\nrandom) initial state, ``_step`` which codes for the state transition dynamic,\n``_set_seed`` which implements the seeding mechanism and finally the\nenvironment specs.\n\n## :func:`_step`\n\nThe step method is the first thing to consider, as it will encode\nthe simulation that is of interest to us. In TorchRL, the :class:`torchrl.envs.EnvBase`\nclass has a :func:`EnvBase.step(tensordict)` method that receives a :class:`tensordict.TensorDict`\ninstance with an ``\"action\"`` entry indicating what action is to be taken.\nTo facilitate the reading and writing from that tensordict and to make sure\nthat the keys are consistent with what's expected from the library, the\nsimulation part has been delegated to a private abstract method :func:`_step`\nwhich reads input data from a tensordict, and writes a new tensordict with the\noutput data.\nThe :func:`_step` method should:\n\n  1. read the input keys (such as ``\"action\"``) and execute the simulation\n     based on these;\n  2. retrieve observations, done state and reward;\n  3. write the set of observation value along with the reward and done state\n     at the corresponding entries in a new :class:`TensorDict`.\n\nNext, the `step` method will rearrange this output and move the key-pair\nvalues of the observation in a new entry named ``\"next\"`` and leave the ``\"reward\"``\nand ``\"done\"`` state at the root level. It will also run some sanity checks\non the shapes of the tensordict content.\n\nTypically, this will look like\n\n```\n>>> print(tensordict)\nTensorDict(TODO)\n>>> env.step(tensordict)\n>>> print(tensordict)\nTensorDict(TODO)\n```\nIn the Pendulum example, our :func:`_step` method will read the relevant entries\nfrom the input tensordict and compute the position and velocity of the\npendulum after the force encoded by the ``\"action\"`` key has been applied\nonto it. We compute the new angular position of the pendulum ``new_th`` as the result\nof the previous position ``th`` plus the new velocity ``new_thdot`` over a\ntime interval ``dt``. Additionally, we pass the ``sin`` and ``cos`` of the\nangle to facilitate learning.\n\nSince our goal is to turn the pendulum up and maintain it still in that\nposition, our ``cost`` (negative reward) function is lower for positions\nclose to the target and low speeds.\nIndeed, we want to punish positions that are far from being \"upward\"\nand/or speeds that are far from 0.\n\nIn our example, :func:`_step` is encoded as a static method since our\nenvironment is stateless. In stateful settings, the ``self`` argument is\nneeded as the state needs to be read from the environment.\n\n\n"

We saw how these\n  methods and classes interact with the :class:`tensordict.TensorDict` class;\n* how to test that an environment is properly coded using\n  :func:`torchrl.envs.utils.check_env_specs`;\n* How to code transforms in the context of stateless environments;\n* How to train a policy on a fully differentiable simulator.\n\n\n"
